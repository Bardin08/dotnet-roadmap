# .NET & Basic Algorithms Roadmap üöÄ

## Introduction

Welcome to the Learning Roadmap for .NET and Basic Algorithms! üåü This roadmap is designed for individuals who are
beginning their journey in software development and are keen to gain a solid foundation in both .NET, a widely used
framework for building a variety of applications and basic algorithms, which are fundamental to effective
problem-solving in programming.

This roadmap will guide you through a structured path üõ£Ô∏è, starting from the basics of .NET, covering essential
programming concepts, and then progressing to fundamental algorithms. Each stage will be equipped with resources üìö,
practical exercises, and projects to reinforce your learning and help you apply theoretical knowledge in real-world
scenarios.

Whether you're a student üë©‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüéì, a budding software developer, or even an experienced programmer looking to refresh your
skills in .NET and algorithms, this roadmap aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience to boost your software
engineering prowess üí™.

## Overview

This roadmap is structured to take you through a comprehensive learning journey in .NET and basic algorithms. It is
divided into several stages, each focusing on different aspects of .NET and foundational algorithmic concepts. The goal
is to build a strong foundation in both areas, enabling you to develop efficient and effective software solutions.

### Stage 1: Introduction to .NET

üå± We start with the basics of .NET, understanding the framework, its components, and how it fits in the software
development ecosystem. You'll get familiar with the .NET runtime, libraries, and the C# programming language. Exploring
advanced topics like object-oriented programming, LINQ, and asynchronous programming. Parallelly, you'll learn about
.NET Core, the cross-platform, open-source version of .NET.

### Stage 2: Basic Algorithms and Data Structures

üìä This stage introduces you to the world of algorithms. Starting with basic data structures like arrays, lists, and
trees, you'll learn how to implement and apply fundamental algorithms, including sorting, searching, and basic graph
algorithms.

### Stage 3: Applying Algorithms in .NET

üõ† In this practical stage, you'll apply your algorithmic knowledge using C# and .NET. This will include building small
projects and solving problems that require algorithmic thinking, reinforcing your understanding of both .NET and
algorithms.

## Stage 0: Tools & IDEs

- **IDE:** [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/First_Steps.html) fast & powerful cross-platform .NET IDE

## Stage 1: Introduction to .NET üå±

- **Objective:** The goal of this stage is to introduce learners to the .NET and the C# programming language. It focuses
  on building a strong foundation in the basics of .NET, understanding its architecture, and getting comfortable with C#
  syntax and basic programming concepts.

- **Topics:**
    - Introduction to .NET: Understand the architecture, components, and the ecosystem of the .NET.
    - Getting Started with C#: Learn the basic syntax of C#, including variables, types, control structures, and basic
      I/O operations.
    - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming: Get a brief introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP)
      principles in the context of C#.
    - .NET CLI and Project Structure: Familiarize yourself with the .NET Command Line Interface (CLI) and understand the
      standard project structure in a .NET application.
- **Resources:**
    - [CodeAcademy (FREE | ~20hrs)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-sharp): beginner-friendly course
      focusing on basic programming concepts in C#.
    - [Introduction to C# (Alternative to CodeAcademy)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/):
      interactive tutorials for beginners to learn C# basics directly in their browser. It covers fundamental concepts
      like data types, control flow, and the List collection type, with practical, hands-on coding examples.
    - [C# Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/CS/index.php): W3Schools offers a comprehensive C# tutorial that covers
      the language's basics to advanced concepts.
    - [What is .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet)
    - [.NET CLI (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQLzp2Z8-BE)
    - [.NET CLI Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/)
    - [Refactoring](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring)
    - [GoF patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/csharp). DO NOT TRY TO REMEMBER ALL OF THEM. JUST READ
      ACROSS TO KNOW WHERE TO SEARCH IN CASE OF NEED.

## Practice and Projects

### Assignment 1: Tic-Tac-Toe with Leaderboard

- Objective: Develop a Tic-Tac-Toe. The game should feature a leaderboard to track wins, losses, and draws.

- Requirements:
  - Gameplay: Implement the classic 3x3 grid gameplay.
  - Player Input: Allow two players to input their moves.
  - Win Logic: Include logic to determine the winner or a draw.
  - Leaderboard:
    - Store the results of each game (win/loss/draw) for each player in a file.
    - Display the leaderboard at the beginning or end of each game session.
  - File Operations:
    - Use file handling to read and write leaderboard data. 
    - Ensure data persistence across game sessions. 
  - Additional Challenges:
    - Implement an AI opponent. 
    - Add an option to reset the leaderboard.
